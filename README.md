# Pascal Examples

Some very simple examples of Pascal.

To use:

- Install the [free pascal compiler](https://www.freepascal.org/).
- Compile either [Fibonacci.pas](Fibonacci.pas) or [helloYou.pas](helloYou.pas) using the relevant command in your terminal or command prompt (on my system, the command is `fpg`)

## Installing freepascal on Mac and Windows

I use a package manager. If you do the same, then installing freepascal is simple.

On Mac, using homebrew:

```{bash}
brew install fpg
```

On Windows, using chocolatey

```{bash}
choco install freepascal
```

On Linx, you may need to [follow the instructions on the freepascal site](https://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/user/usersu5.html).
